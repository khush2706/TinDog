# TinDog

Made this website for a startup idea which is "Tinder for Dogs". This project has helped me learn Bootstrap4 along with helping me polish my HTML and CSS skills.

## Code

I have used Bootstrap components like carousel, containers, grids, cards, navbars etc. to design various parts of this website. Along with bootstrap I have used css's media query to make this website responsive.
I have also learned the concept of code-refactoring as well as some advanced css concepts like z-index.
